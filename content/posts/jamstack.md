The [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) is a new way to develop websites that aims to deliver better performance, higher security and lower cost of scaling.

So what does the JAMStack stands for?

It means **J**avascript **A**PI **M**arkup stack.

All the programming is done on the client side using javascript.

No databases, web servers are used when developing under the JAMStack. Instead, third party API's that provider services like authentication, data persistency or content management are used. Examples of services like this are [auth0](https://auth0.com), [firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and [contentful](https://www.contentful.com).

Templated markup which is prebuilt at deploy through static site generates such as [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) or build tools such as [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com).

## Origins

The JAMStack was pioneered by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) between 2016 and 2017. The intent was to address some of the limitations of static websites, which tend to be less sophisticated and harder to maintain. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify#JAMstack))
